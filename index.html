										<h2 class="major">Literature review</h2>
										<p>Several innovative small-scale wind turbines are emerging to address the needs of renewable energy generation. One of them is the Liam F1 Wind Turbine, innovative by its Archimedean screw inspired horizontal axis design, which turned out to have an outstanding performance with a peak power coefficient of 0.293 under specific conditions (Jang et al., 2019), with ongoing efforts to explore cost-effective 3D printing for production (Magaña, 2024). Another turbine is the Tesup V7 with a vertical axis alternative, offering a 7kW capacity, a potentially significant daily energy output, and blade customization options. Next Another vertical design, the Turbine Flower, features a unique aesthetic and scalable energy production ranging 3000-5000W and 2000 kWh yearly, with studies highlighting its rapid stabilization at low wind speeds (Nugraha et al., 2025) and an alleged environmentally friendly operation due to its slow rotation, with ongoing material refinement from PLA to fiberglass and carbon fiber (Galaxy, 2024). Finally, the Ventum VX175 with its enclosed design for optimization and acceleration of urban winds (Stumpf, n.d.), offering a compact solution with noise levels of 40 dB at moderate wind speeds (Ferrell, 2024), reportedly delivering 3000kWh with a 6m/s wind, 5100kWh with an 8m/s and 6100kWh at 10m/s wind. These different designs show a
										range of innovative ideas to obtain wind energy in various environments, highlighting key considerations such as efficiency, cost, scalability, and environmental impact.</p>

											<h3 class="major"> Problem Definition</h3>
											<p>Creating and designing a small-scale wind turbine for remote communities or residential use requires addressing several key factors like, ensuring there is sufficient energy production, achieving cost-effectiveness, and minimizing noise pollution. The choice of material is crucial because there needs to be a balance between cost and durability. Furthermore, the turbine needs to be environmentally friendly, minimizing any disruption to the ecosystem and wildlife. Finally, it is important to work with the constraints and available technology to create a sustainable energy solution.</p>
											<p>- How to create a wind turbine that can be used to produce enough electricity for a remote community for a house?</p>
											<p>While searching for the best innovative designs of wind turbines, meaning the most effective and environmentally friendly, I came up with the idea to merge them and create a turbine that can work with low wind and accelerate small wind currents, so the turbine is always working. The turbines I decided to merge were the LIAM F1 wind turbine and the VENTUM VX175.</p>
											<p>- How to make that wind turbine cost effective?</p>
											<p>On average German consumers pay around 38¢ per kilowatt hour. “An average three-person household with an annual heating requirement of 20,000 kilowatt hours (kWh), electricity consumption of 4,000 kWh and annual car mileage of 13,300 kilometres currently spends 5,407 euros a year on energy. In 2021, the figure was 4,121 euros”(Household Energy Prices in Germany Almost a Third Higher Than Before Ukraine War Started - Analysis, 2025), this gives us a range of how much a turbine can cost and how much energy it need to produce for it to be cost efficient for the consumer.</p>
											<p>- How to make that wind turbine as silent as possible?</p>
											<p>The design of the VENTUM VX175 has been shown to produce around 40dB at 6m/s of noise pollution, and the LIAM F1 design has been shown to produce 45dB at 6m/s of noise pollution, so combined, they should not produce above 45dB at 6m/s of noise pollution. Since the allowed sound pollution is 60dB for an urban turbine, this means this should be fine.</p>
											<p>- What materials can be used?</p>
											<p>Most turbines in the world are made from these materials: the leading material is
											steel with 66-79% of the total turbines made from it, followed by fiberglass resin or plastic with 11-16% of the turbines made from it, Iron or cast iron with 5-17%, copper with 1%, and aluminum with 0-2%. For this specific project, the best option would be to make the turbine out of fiberglass and plastic since its low wind speeds do not require as strong materials as steel.</p>
											<p>- Where can I install it so it can exploit its full potential?</p>
											<p>This technology could exploit its full potential installed in roofs close to the edge, so the turbine can take advantage of the wind currents that the house or the building pushes towards the top of it, where it can take advantage since the average wind speed at 30m in Germany in flat inland areas 3.4-4m/s or in offshore locations in can have an annually average of 5m/s.</p>
											<p>- How to make this turbine environmentally friendly?</p>
											<p>Since this turbine is made of covered Liam F1 blades by a frame by using this
											design of the blades reduces the damage a bird can cause if it enters the turbine.</p>
											<p>- What are my technology limitations?</p>
											<p>One of the limitations would be the size, since it needs to be at least 2m^3, since it needs the space for the blades to fit inside the frame, and also it needs to be somehow raised above the surface for it to collect the maximum amount of wind.</p>
											<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/IMG_4.jpg" alt="" /></a>
											<h3 class="major"> Objective settings</h3>
											<p>- Energy generation:</p>
											<p>Since this is a new technology and it is made by two of the most advanced urban wind turbines of the moment (LIAM F1 wind turbine and the VENTUM VX175) this product should be producing +1.500kWh per year at 5m/s wind speed.</p>
											<p>- Aesthetic integration:</p>
											<p>This turbine does not need to be completely aesthetic since it would be installed on the roof of the buildings meaning they would not be visible from the ground floor, although its modern design makes it visually appealing for people who like technology.</p>
											<p>- Noise reduction:</p>
											<p>To guarantee the noise regulations are being followed, the turbine design must
											comply with the German Technical Instructions on Noise (TA Lärm), which has
											stablished a limit of 60 dB. Studies show that, at an average wind speed of 6 m/s, the
											VENTUM VX175 produces 40 dB, while the LIAM F1 generates 45 dB. Therefore, this
											design with the LIAM turbine and the VENTUM, when operating it must to remain in the
											45 dB range at a 6 m/s average wind speed to meeting the noise requirements.</p>
											<p>- Environmental measures:</p>
											<p>The turbine design was created to minimize potential harm to birds and other small
											animals. The frame's small openings are designed to prevent entry, and the LIAM
											turbine blades cover almost the entire upper surface, limiting access and reducing the
											risk of injury. Furthermore, the turbine's generation of clean, renewable wind energy
											contributes to a reduction in reliance on fossil fuels and a decrease in carbon emissions
											in urban environments.</p>
											<p>- Economic viability:</p>
											<p>To get cost-effectiveness while maintaining structural integrity, fiberglass turned out to be the best optionas. While steel offers a lower initial cost, the complex shape of this turbine would need extensive material removal during fabrication, leading to more waste and overall cost. Although
											a fiberglass construction is expected to cost approximately
											$3000 USD due to the price of fiberglass, potential challenges could lead to a higher
											final production cost. Also this price does not include the labor costs associated with the
											manufacturing of this turbine. Assuming a market price of $10,000 USD, this turbine is
											projected to produce a minimum of 1,500 kWh per year. Under these conditions, a
											household would get back their initial investment in approximately 16 years, excluding
											potential savings due to the recent four year 13% increase in electricity costs.</p>

											<h3 class="major">Idea Generation</h3>
											<p>The research process revealed some worthlooking technologies, including the so called Flower turbine. An initial concept explored the integration of these turbines as leaves within a tree like structure, but this ended not beeing functional enough do to the size of the turbines. In the other hand the Liam F1 wind turbine could have potential for cost reduction through alternative material selection, which could enhance its market viability. Furthermore,
											The Ventum VX175 also led to the idea of using the Liam F1
											turbine instead, since the Liam F1 is known to work well even when there isn't a lot of
											wind so this was the wining idea.</p>
